    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="images/introduction.jpg" alt="Rainforest Overview" class="main-image">
    <p>The rainforest is one of the most vital ecosystems on our planet. These lush, biodiverse regions are home to millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms, many of which cannot be found anywhere else. Rainforests play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate, producing oxygen, and maintaining biodiversity.</p>

<section id="importance">
    <h2>Importance of Rainforests</h2>
    <img src="images/importance.jpg" alt="Importance of Rainforests" class="main-image">
    <p>Rainforests are often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" because they produce a significant amount of the worldâ€™s oxygen through photosynthesis. They also act as a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and helping to mitigate climate change.</p>
    <p>In addition to their environmental benefits, rainforests provide resources such as timber, medicinal plants, and food products. Many indigenous communities rely on these forests for their livelihoods, traditions, and cultural identities.</p>

<section id="threats">
    <h2>Threats to Rainforests</h2>
    <img src="images/threats.jpg" alt="Threats to Rainforests" class="img">
    <p>Despite their importance, rainforests face severe threats from human activities. Deforestation, primarily for agriculture, logging, and urban expansion, leads to habitat loss and fragmentation. This not only threatens the species that live in these forests but also affects global climate patterns.</p>
    <p>Additionally, climate change poses a significant threat to rainforests. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can disrupt the delicate balance of these ecosystems, leading to further biodiversity loss.</p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <img src="images/conclusion.jpg" alt="Conclusion on Rainforests" class="img">
    <p>Protecting rainforests is essential for the health of our planet. Efforts to conserve these vital ecosystems must be prioritized to ensure a sustainable future for all living organisms. By raising awareness and promoting sustainable practices, we can help preserve the beauty and biodiversity of rainforests for generations to come.</p>
